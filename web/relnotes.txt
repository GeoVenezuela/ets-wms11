2	When an exception is generated, it validates
3	For each format a request with TRANSPARENT=TRUE does not return an exception.
4	For each image format advertised in capabilities, When a GetMap request is made using the image format, then the Content-type entity header returned is the format requested.
5	For each SRS in the capabilities document, when a GetMap request uses the SRS, then the response is valid.
6	For each of the Layers in the capabilities document, when a GetMap request is made with the LAYERS parameter set to the element of the layer, then the response is valid.
7	For each of the Styles in the capabilities document, when a GetMap request is made with the STYLES parameter set to the element of the style, then the response is valid.
8	For each advertised GetFeatureInfo format, when a GetFeatureInfo request is made with the INFO_FORMAT parameter set to the format, then the Content-type header returned is the same.
